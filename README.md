# Snake Game

## Description
PySnake is a simple snake game implemented using Python and the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to control a snake, consume food, and grow in size while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## Features
- Classic snake movement (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- Score tracking system
- Randomized fruit spawning
- Game-over conditions for wall and self-collisions
- Simple and minimalistic interface

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the Pygame library if you haven't already.

### Install Pygame:
```sh
pip install pygame
```

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone or download the script.
2. Navigate to the script directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the game using:
   ```sh
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake in the respective direction
- **Esc / Close Window**: Exit the game

## Game Rules
1. The snake moves in the chosen direction automatically.
2. Eating a fruit increases the score and extends the snake's length.
3. The game ends if the snake collides with the window boundaries or itself.

## Future Improvements
- Adding a start menu and difficulty levels
- Implementing different fruit types with varying effects
- Enhancing visual aesthetics and adding sound effects
